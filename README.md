# TPX-Realty-Website
My very first website built from scratch for a local real estate company using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The background hero image is actually a photo of a house im building in blender. Used Unreal Engine 5 to build the enviorment. Will eventually turn it into a game of some sort.
